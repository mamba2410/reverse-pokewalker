**This project (and wiki) has been superceded by [this article](http://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&proj=28.%20pokewalker) by Dmitry.GR.**
**This repo has been shelved since the goal it was aiming for has been acheived. See below for active related projects.**
**Huge thanks again to Dmitry who cracked it all on his own - and thanks to the contributors to this repo.**
